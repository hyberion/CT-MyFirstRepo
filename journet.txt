We came from the mainland with hope.  But time, luck, and weather have ground us down.  Now were just stare out at the sea, bitter 
and hollow-eyed.  Blunted by desperation and desperate in need.

The curses to fate fall from our cracked lips onto the sand.  
We are breft now of hope.  We are skeleton souls, trapped in hell.
Waiting.
